## Blockers and Dependencies

### Current Blockers
- None identified - testing infrastructure complete, ready for feature tests

### Dependencies
1. **Test Infrastructure Setup** - Required before any tests can be implemented
2. **Mock Services** - Needed for isolated testing
3. **Test Database** - Required for integration tests
4. **CI/CD Pipeline** - Needed for automated testing

### Risk Mitigation
- Start with unit tests that have fewer dependencies
- Implement mocks early to unblock development
- Set up CI/CD pipeline incrementally
- Focus on high-priority tests first

---

## Team Assignments

### Suggested Task Distribution
- **Frontend Developer**: UI component tests, E2E user journeys
- **Backend Developer**: API tests, database tests, worker tests
- **DevOps Engineer**: CI/CD setup, infrastructure tests
- **QA Engineer**: E2E tests, security validation, test data management

### Review Process
- All test code requires peer review
- Security tests require additional security review
- E2E tests require cross-browser validation
- Performance tests require benchmarking review
