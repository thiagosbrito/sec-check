# E2E Testing Strategy for SecCheck

## Overview

Our e2e testing strategy covers three main areas:
1. **API Testing** - Direct testing of our refactored scan service APIs
2. **UI Integration** - Testing the complete user flow from frontend to backend
3. **Cross-browser/Device** - Ensuring functionality across different environments

## Test Structure

### 1. API E2E Tests (`scan-api.spec.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Test the scan API endpoints directly without UI dependencies
- **Coverage**: 
  - Valid scan requests
  - Input validation
  - Error handling
  - Health checks
  - Edge cases (malformed requests, rate limiting)

**Benefits of our refactored architecture:**
- Clean service separation makes API testing much easier
- Single responsibility services are easier to test in isolation
- Predictable error responses and status codes

### 2. Integration E2E Tests (`scan-integration.spec.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Test the complete user journey from UI interaction to API response
- **Coverage**:
  - Full scan flow (UI → API → Response)
  - Real-time validation
  - Error state handling in UI
  - Loading states
  - Accessibility (keyboard navigation)
  - Edge cases (long URLs, slow responses)

### 3. Landing Page E2E Tests (`landing-page.spec.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Test core UI functionality and responsiveness
- **Coverage**:
  - Page loading and basic elements
  - Navigation functionality
  - Mobile responsiveness
  - Hero section interaction
  - Cross-browser compatibility

## Improvements Made

### 1. Robust Selectors
- Use `getByRole()` and `getByTestId()` instead of text-based selectors
- Implement fallback strategies for mobile vs desktop
- Add generous timeouts for slow-loading elements

### 2. Better Wait Strategies
- Use `waitForLoadState('networkidle')` for fully loaded pages
- Implement proper `toBeEnabled()` waits for interactive elements
- Add conditional logic for mobile/desktop differences

### 3. Error Resilience
- Mock API responses for error testing
- Test loading states and disabled buttons
- Handle responsive design differences gracefully

## Running E2E Tests

```bash
# Run all e2e tests
pnpm test:e2e

# Run specific test file
pnpm test:e2e e2e/scan-api.spec.ts

# Run with specific browser
pnpm test:e2e --project=webkit

# Run in headed mode for debugging
pnpm test:e2e --headed

# Generate test report
pnpm test:e2e --reporter=html
```

## Test Data Strategy

### 1. Safe Test URLs
- Use `https://httpbin.org/*` for safe API testing
- Use `https://example.com` for basic validation
- Avoid scanning real production websites in tests

### 2. Mock Strategies
- Mock slow API responses to test loading states
- Mock error responses to test error handling
- Use route interception for controlling API behavior

## Benefits of Our Refactored Architecture for E2E Testing

### 1. Predictable API Responses
- Clean service separation makes responses consistent
- Well-defined error codes and status codes
- Easier to mock and test edge cases

### 2. Testable Components
- Single responsibility services are easier to test
- Clear input/output contracts
- Better separation of concerns

### 3. Maintainable Tests
- Tests are less brittle due to clean architecture
- Service mocking is straightforward
- Error scenarios are well-defined

## Monitoring and Reporting

### 1. Test Results
- HTML reports with screenshots and videos
- JUnit XML for CI/CD integration
- JSON results for programmatic analysis

### 2. Failure Analysis
- Screenshots on failure
- Video recordings of failed tests
- Network request logs
- Console error logs

## CI/CD Integration

The e2e tests are designed to run in CI environments with:
- Retry logic for flaky tests
- Parallel execution for faster feedback
- Comprehensive reporting for debugging failures
- Environment-specific configuration

## Future Enhancements

1. **Authentication Flow Testing**
   - Add tests for authenticated user scans
   - Test rate limiting with real user sessions
   - Test plan-based restrictions

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Add tests for API response times
   - Test concurrent scan requests
   - Monitor resource usage

3. **Security Testing**
   - Test XSS prevention
   - Test CSRF protection
   - Test rate limiting effectiveness

4. **Database Integration**
   - Test scan result persistence
   - Test usage statistics tracking
   - Test billing integration
