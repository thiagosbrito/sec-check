  {
    question: "Is SecCheck safe to use on my production website?",
    answer: "Yes, absolutely. SecCheck uses only passive and safe active testing methods. We never attempt to exploit vulnerabilities or cause any damage to your website. Our tests are designed to detect security issues without impacting your site's functionality or data."
  },
  {
    question: "What types of vulnerabilities does SecCheck detect?",
    answer: "SecCheck tests for the OWASP Top 10 security risks including injection flaws, broken authentication, sensitive data exposure, XML external entities, broken access control, security misconfigurations, cross-site scripting, insecure deserialization, vulnerable components, and insufficient logging & monitoring."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a security scan take?",
    answer: "Most scans complete within 2-5 minutes depending on your website's size and complexity. Our automated testing runs in parallel to provide fast results while maintaining thoroughness."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to install anything on my website?",
    answer: "No installation required. SecCheck works by analyzing your publicly accessible website from the outside, just like a real attacker would. For domain verification (Pro plan), you may need to upload a simple HTML file or add a DNS record."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in the security report?",
    answer: "Our reports include detailed vulnerability descriptions, risk ratings, evidence of findings, and step-by-step remediation instructions. Each issue is mapped to OWASP categories with clear explanations for both technical and non-technical audiences."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I scan websites I don't own?",
    answer: "You can scan any publicly accessible website for basic reconnaissance, but detailed vulnerability testing requires domain verification to ensure you have permission to test the website. This protects against unauthorized scanning."
  },
  {
    question: "How does SecCheck compare to other security scanners?",
    answer: "SecCheck focuses specifically on OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities with an emphasis on actionable results. Unlike complex enterprise tools, we provide clear, prioritized findings that developers can immediately act upon, with no false positives from misconfigured scans."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there an API available?",
    answer: "Yes, Pro and Enterprise plans include REST API access for automated scanning integration. You can trigger scans, retrieve reports, and manage your account programmatically. API documentation is available in your dashboard."
